# My Agents

Welcome to **My Agents**, a collection of AI agents I’m building as I explore and learn new tools and frameworks. This repo serves as a playground for experimenting with **PHIDATA**, **LangChain**, and **Langraph** to create and understand AI agent workflows.

---

## 📚 What’s in the Repo?

This repository will include:

- **Basic AI Agents**: Simple agents that showcase foundational concepts.
- **Intermediate Projects**: Agents combining multiple tools and workflows.
- **Advanced Experiments**: Exploring complex pipelines and integrations.

Each agent is organized into its own folder with code, dependencies, and a brief explanation.

## 🛠 Tools I'm Using

- **PHIDATA**: A framework for building AI agents with memory, knowledge, tools, and reasoning capabilities, enabling them to work individually or in teams. 
- **LangChain**: For chaining together LLMs and other tools to create intelligent workflows.
- **Langraph**:LangGraph is a framework for building LLM applications by representing their execution flow as a graph, enabling more complex and manageable interactions.
