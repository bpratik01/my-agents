Got it! Here's a simpler, learning-focused README for your `my-agents` repo:

---

# My Agents

Welcome to **My Agents**, a collection of AI agents I’m building as I explore and learn new tools and frameworks. This repo serves as a playground for experimenting with **PHIDATA**, **LangChain**, and **Langraph** to create and understand AI agent workflows.

---

## 📚 What’s in the Repo?

This repository will include:

- **Basic AI Agents**: Simple agents that showcase foundational concepts.
- **Intermediate Projects**: Agents combining multiple tools and workflows.
- **Advanced Experiments**: Exploring complex pipelines and integrations.

Each agent is organized into its own folder with code, dependencies, and a brief explanation.

---

## 🛠 Tools I'm Using

- **PHIDATA**: A framework for building AI agents with memory, knowledge, tools, and reasoning capabilities, enabling them to work individually or in teams. 
- **LangChain**: For chaining together LLMs and other tools to create intelligent workflows.
- **Langraph**:LangGraph is a framework for building LLM applications by representing their execution flow as a graph, enabling more complex and manageable interactions.

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This repo is a work in progress, and I’ll be adding more agents as I learn. Feel free to check back for updates or explore the agents I’ve built so far!

## 📝 Why This Repo?

This is a personal learning space for experimenting with AI agents. It’s not about polished products—it’s about growth, curiosity, and hands-on practice.
